        Block level elements take up as much space as possible by default. Each block level element will start a new
        line on the page, stacking down the page. In addition to stacking vertically, block level elements will also
        take up as much horizontal space as possible. The p element is an example of a block level element.

        Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is
